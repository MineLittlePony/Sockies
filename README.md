Brings a whole lot of cute and fuzzy foot accessories to Minecraft!

### Recipes

They're basically wool boots. Combine different colours of wool to change the sock's appearance. More colours gives more complex patterns:

- 1 colour = plain socks
- 2 colours = striped socks
- 3 colours = polkadot socks
- 4 colours = rainbow socks

More sock types and trinkets support coming soon!

### Building

`git clone https://github.com/MineLittlePony/Sockies`
`cd Sockies`
`gradlew build`

Built jars are located in /build/bin` within the Sockies folder after performing the above two command.
